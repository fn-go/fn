# 2022-05-02 Update

The syntax I'm working on continues to diverge from task v3. The more I think about how things should work, the more I try to simplify & make this intuitive, and the more posted issues I investigate, the more my design diverges.

## Divergences

Here's some of the major divergences I'm currently experimenting with:

_There are issues out there for all these things, but it would take me awhile to link to all them, so I may come back and do this._

---

### `Functions`

---

A single `task` feels like a `function`. You have (optional) inputs, and there's also desire to have functions produce _outputs_.

More on this later...

---

### `Cmds vs Deps vs Vars`

---

The difference between `cmds` and `deps` feels like it should be narrow, but in fact, it's quite hairy as currently implementing in task.

What I see is things running serially or in parallel.

`Vars` support `sh` which makes feel a bit like `cmd`.

Reality is that there's an "evaluation priority", and it's not immediately or intuitively create what the evaluation priority is, or even _should be_.

This is fundamentally different and unintuitive when compared to a run-of-the-mill function such as in Go.

> Example of some simple functions

```Go
func Build() {
  os.Exec("go build .")
}

func Test() {
  Build()
  os.Exec("go test ./...")
}
```

> Task equivalent

```yaml
tasks:
  build:
    cmds:
    - go build .
  test:
    deps:
    - build
    cmds:
    - go test ./...

  # OR

  test:
    cmds:
    - task: build
    - go test ./...
```

One recent change I found I really needed is the _removal_ of `deps` entirely, and expand upon different "step types", like in [ConcourseCI](https://concourse-ci.org/steps.html).

```yaml
fns:
  build:
    do:
    - go build .

  test:
    do:
    - fn: build
    - go test ./...
```

---

### `Deciding what to do (Decisions & Memoization)`

---

How would we handle, simply, various scenarios for deciding what to run?

---

#### `Arbitrary Memoization`

Function definition only memoization

---

> Example of preventing the same task from running multiple times

```Go
cache := memoize.NewMemoizer()

func Foo() error {
  // Something expensive, e.g.
  time.Sleep(3 * time.Second)
  return nil
}

func FooMemoized() error {
  return cache.Run(Foo)
}

func Complicated() error {
  err := FooMemoized()
  if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("fooing: %w", err)
  }
  return nil
}
```

> The Future

```yaml
fns:
  # optionally declare a non-memozied function
  # only required if there are cases where
  # you want to do/recalcuate every time it's called
  foo:
    do:
    - sleep 3

  foo:mem:
    memoize: true
    do:
    - fn: foo

  complicated:
    do:
    - fn: foo:mem
    - go test ./...
```

---

#### `Sources/Generates`

---

```Go
func GenHam() {
  hamRaw := "ham.raw"

  // get last modified time
  hamRawFile, err := os.Stat(hamRaw)
  // handle file doesn't exist
  hamRawModifiedTime := hamRawFile.ModTime()

  hamCookedFile, err := os.Stat(hamRaw)
  if err == nil {  
    hamCookedModifiedTime := hamCookedFile.ModTime()
    if hamRawModifiedTime < hamCookedModifiedTime {
      return
    }
  }

  cook(hamRawFile)
}
```

The above code can be abstracted into a reusable decision function, which then can be `memoized`. Noting that `memoization` takes into account all inputs, include the `do` function in as a combined cache key.

_this is a naive example, since functions cannot be used as a map key. Instead, this would be implemented similar to how the template.FuncMap works, where functions are named, and thus we are caching the name, not the actual function._

```Go
func FileModifiedDecision(sources []strings, generates []strings, do func() error) error {
  greatestSourceModified := GetMaxModified(sources)
  greatestGeneratesModifed := GetMaxModified(generates)

  if greatestSourceModified > greatestGeneratesModifed {
    return do()
  }

  return nil 
}
```

This leads to the following:

```yaml
fns:
  ham:
    memoize:
      sources:
        ham.raw: {}
      generates:
        ham.cooked: {}
    do:
    - cook ham.raw > ham.cooked

  breakfast:
    do:
    - fn: ham
```

---

#### Inputs & Outputs

---

```go
// item should be a pointer
func Cook(item interface{}, temp int, timer time.Duration) {
  oven.Load(item)
  oven.SetTemp(temp)
  return oven.Start(timer)
}

cache := memoize.NewMemoizer()

func CookMemoized(item interface{}, temp int, timer time.Duration) {
  cache.Run(Cook, item, temp, timer)
}
```

```yaml
fns:
  cook:
    memoize: true
    inputs:
      item:
        description: the food to cook
        required: true
        type: any
      temp:
        description: oven temperature needed
        default: 400
        type: number
      timer:
        description: how long to cook for
        required: true
        type: number
    do:
    - |-
      oven \
        --load {{.inputs.item}} \
        --temp {{.inputs.temp}} \
        --timer {{.inputs.timer}}
```

---

#### Parallelism

---

```go
// purposefully over-simplified
func AllTheThings(things ...Runner) {
  var things []Runner

  things = append(things, newThing1()) 
  things = append(things, newThing2())
  things = append(things, newThing3())

  for _, thing := range things {
    go thing.Run()
  }
}
```

```yaml
fns:
  all-the-things:
    do:
    - parallel:
      - thing1
      - thing2
      - thing3
```

There's even more I can write, but this post is already getting pretty long. The main point of this writing is that this is significantly diverging from `Task`, at this point.

Since backwards compatibility is still important for some folks, I've decided to move my work to [go-fn/fn](https://github.com/go-fn/fn). This will allow me open/creative freedom to look at the space, requirements, use-cases, constraints, abstractions, etc and develop something without forcing me into a situation of trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.
