## Introduction

Fn is a general purpose automation tool that aims to be simpler and more flexible than similar tools such as: Make, Task, and Rake.

Fn aims to have a human-centered design, with emphasis on usability and aesthetics.

> Even the smartest among us can feel inept as we fail to figure out which light switch or oven burner to turn on, or whether to push, pull, or slide a door.
The fault lies not in ourselves, but in product design that ignores the needs of users and the principles of cognitive psychology. 
> 
> The problems range from ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable demands on memorization.

> The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints. The goal: guide the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the right time.

` - The Design of Everyday Things`

An example to get you started:

> `fnfile.yml`
```yaml
version: '1'
fns:
  hello:
    do: echo "Hello, World!"
```

```shell
‚ùØ fn hello
Hello, World
```

## Getting Started

```shell
go install github.com/go-fn/fn
```
